# Cloning and setting up the demo source code

## Installing the Habitat Fitness Demo App

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Habitat Fitness Repo 
You can find the Habitat Fitness demo project here:
https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Omni

You can either download and unzip the project to a location of your choosing, or you can open a terminal/command line to that location and clone it with the following command:

```text
git clone https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Omni.git
```

### Step 2 (optional): Create .env file with Google Maps and Firebase API Keys 
If you are using Google Maps or Firebase, you will likely need to store your various keys. In your app folder (in this case, /fitness/app), create a new file named .env as a sibling of package.json, and add the following to its contents:

```text
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<insert-yours-here>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_PUSH_KEY=<insert-yours-here>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID=<insert-yours-here>
```

### Step 3: Install the JSS CLI
Note: If you've been working in disconnected mode, you probably already have the JSS CLI installed.
Open a terminal/console window and execute the following command to install the JSS CLI:
```text
npm install -g @sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-cli
```
### Step 4:	Install Required NPM Modules
Open a terminal/console window in the `<repo root>\fitness\app` folder where package.json resides, and run the following command:

```text
npm install
```

This will install all the NPM Modules required by the project.
